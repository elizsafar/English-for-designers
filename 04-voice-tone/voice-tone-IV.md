# Chapter IV

For someone, copying is not acceptable, but honestly, it is the way I learn new things. I think that copying is important for everyday life, work, education, fashion style basically for everything. Even the greatest artists, graphic studios, and bloggers are copying each other.
I began conscious copying when I started with oil painting. I found someoneâ€™s painting and created the same one. That experience gave me a lot of lessons. I learned how to mix colors, which brush to use, and it made me a better painter. For me painting the still life is in some way copying as well. We try to capture reality as accurately as possible. Is that not copying?

Also, in the fashion industry, copying always happens. You will see someone on the street wearing a cute dress or coat, and you want to have the same, then you search for it on every website. Big brands are copying styles from the eighties and twenties, taking some aspects from them. You can take something old, mixed it, and make a new style from it. Just find it and do it!
Even when I found new graphic programs, I would always search for YouTube tutorials and sometimes do the same thing as they show. Because of it, I can take advantage of it and use it in my work.
