# Chapter IV

For someone, copying is not acceptable, but honestly, for me, it is the way I learn new things. I think that copying is important for everyday life, work, education, fashion style basically for everything. Even the greatest artist, graphic studios, bloggers are copying each other. 

I began conscious copying when I started with oil painting. I found someone's painting and created the same one. That gives me a lot of lessons. I found how to mixed colors, what brush to use, it made me a better painter. For me painting the still life is in someway copying as well. We try to capture reality as accurately as possible. That's not copying?  

Also in the fashion industry, always happened that you saw someone on street wearing a cute dress, coat and you want to have the same and searched for him on every website. Big brands are copying styles from the '80s, the twenties, and taking some aspects from them. You can take something old mixed it and make a new style from it. Just find it and do it! 

Even when I found new graphic programs, I always search for some Youtube tutorials and do sometimes the same thing as they show. Because of it I can take it in advance and use it in my work.
