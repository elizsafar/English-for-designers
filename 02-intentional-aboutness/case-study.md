## The Infographic you are not used to ##

This project was the last project we created as a group for our finale semestral work in the second year. I created this project with my school mates. We were a group of 4. As everyone know, it was lockdown due to Corona virus so we were working just via internet and zoom calls. God bless for it. 

#### What was the topic of the semestral work? 

- Make a graph. Infographic. Data visualization model. 

*That was the topic. Well. We did it but in our way.*

First we had to find a theme, that would be interesting enough to work with, than we had to do a research and find some inpiration. It was lots of long nights. 
Our first big problem was to find something not boring, something differennt and most of all, enjoy it and have fun *(at home 24/7)*.
