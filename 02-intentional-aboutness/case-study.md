## The Infographic you are not used to ##

This project was the last project we created as a group for our finale semestral work in the second year. I created this project with my school mates. We were a group of 4. As everyone know, it was lockdown due to Corona virus so we were working just via internet and zoom calls. God bless for it. 

#### What was the topic of the semestral work? 

- Make a graph. Infographic. Data visualization model. 

*That was the topic. Well. We did it but in our way.*

First we had to find a theme, that would be interesting enough to work with, than we had to do a research and find some inpiration. It was lots of long nights. 
Our first big problem was to find something not boring, something differennt and most of all, enjoy it and have fun *(at home 24/7)*.

`Our group. We were not bored at all.`

<br />
As a research we found that the *„graph“* in czech *„graf“* means something different in German. What? Well something enormously different. In German *der GRAF* means *count*. Yes. *Count.* You are maybe thinking how could the *count* has something to do with common graph and infographic at all. 
For us that meant : every counts family has their own familytrees (lineage), erbs, lots of affairs, descendantes. And thats how the idea was born. 
#### But where could we find a count family to make a lineage for?  
So we created imaginary count families and thats it.
<br />
#### The imaginary count family? WHAT? HOW?
We made 4 different imaginary genus. 
The 4 genus were based on our behavior and from that we assigned real people as our overtones, who lived in the past or live now, we were also inspired by world events, which we incorporated into our family tree and created a unique imaginary history of 4 pedigrees, which over time met, due to marriage or events. 
<br />
For example my family is mixed with kind and truly lovely people but we have our not such a clasicc history. My grandgrandfather is Heinrich Himmler, Max Ernst,or my grandauntie Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon well you cant pick your ancestors.

#### FORM
The form we did for our finale poster is different than you would expect from infographic poster. We wanted to make something not common, something you had to go deep in and have fun with just looking at it. We wanted people to be interested in enough to go to our web and say „what is that?“ and have lots of questions.
