## The Infographic you are not used to ##

This project was the last project we created as a group for our finale semestral work in the second year. I created this project with my school mates. We were a group of 4. As everyone know, it was lockdown due to Corona virus so we were working just via internet and zoom calls. God bless for it. 

#### What was the topic of the semestral work? 

- Make a graph. Infographic. Data visualization model. 

*That was the topic. Well. We did it but in our way.*

First we had to find a theme, that would be interesting enough to work with, than we had to do a research and find some inpiration. It was lots of long nights. 
Our first big problem was to find something not boring, something differennt and most of all, enjoy it and have fun *(at home 24/7)*.

As a research we found that the *„graph“* in czech *„graf“* means something different in German. ####What? Well something enormously different. In German *der GRAF* means *count*. Yes. *Count.* You are maybe thinking how could the *count* has something to do with common graph and infographic at all. 
For us that meant : every counts family has their own familytrees (lineage), erbs, lots of affairs, descendantes. And thats how the idea was born.
##### But where could we find a count family to make a lineage for? We could create imaginary count family and thats what we did.

#### The imaginary count family? WHAT? HOW?
We made 4 different imaginary genus. We took our behaviour, world history, known significant people as Einstein, Royal family
That was it. We did as a graph a lineage.
